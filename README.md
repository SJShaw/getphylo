# getphylo
a python package for automated generation of heuristic phylogenetic trees from genbank files

## Description

##Installation

## Usage
This package has been designed to be as easy to run as possible. Simply navigate to a working directory containing .gbk files and input:

`getphylo`

This will run the software on default settings and output all alignments and trees.

There may be occasions where you need to change the default settings. A full list of options and flags can be viewed with:

`getphylo -h`

## Examples
See the ´example_data´ folder in this directory for three example trees produced by `getphylo`.

1. A phylogeny of bacterial genomes
2. A phylogeny of eukaryotic mitochondrial genomes
3. A phylogeny of a biosynthetic super cluster
4. A phylogeny of primate genomes
