# getphylo examples

Here are three examples of trees generated by `getphylo`. To recreate each tree for yourself, simply copy the genbank files from each folder into a new directory and type the command as shown below. All images in this section were created by viewing the resulting combined_tree.tree in iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/). All times recorded on a Intel Xeon E5-1660 v4 processor at 3.20GHz.

## Example 1 - Bacterial Genomes
The first example is a genome level phylogeny of bacteria. It was run with the command `getphylo -g '*.gb' -s Escherichia_coli.gb`. The combined tree was based on 73 loci and took 43 seconds.

## Example 2 - Eukaryotic Mitochondrial Genomes
The second example is a phylogeny of eukaryotic mitochondrial genomes. It was run with the command `getphylo -p 50 -s Plasmodium_falciparum.gbk`. The combined tree was based on 2 loci and took 2 seconds.

## Example 3 - Biosynthetic Super Cluster
The third example shows the evolutionary history of the anthrabenzoxocinone-borregomycin supercluster (*bab*) as described in our paper: ['Chlorinated metabolites from Streptomyces sp. highlight the role of biosynthetic mosaics and superclusters in the evolution of chemical diversity.'](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1OB00600B) It was generated in X seconds.
